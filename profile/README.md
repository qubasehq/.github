## Qubase — We secure how you use AI


Most companies are racing to adopt AI. Very few are prepared for what comes next.

### What We're Doing

Qubase is building the security layer for generative AI in the enterprise.

We’re not adapting old security tools. We’re designing new ones—purpose-built to detect, redact, and control what’s flowing in and out of LLMs. Sensitive data, compliance boundaries, and AI misuse aren’t theoretical risks anymore. They’re happening daily. And most teams have no idea.

Qubase provides:

- A real-time protection layer between users and AI systems  
- Redaction of sensitive inputs and outputs (PII, PHI, financials, trade secrets)  
- Central governance for AI usage across tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard  
- Policy enforcement, risk analytics, and compliance reporting  

---

### Why This Matters

AI is being embedded into every tool, team, and workflow. The average enterprise already uses dozens of AI-enabled products—many without proper oversight. Shadow AI is growing faster than shadow IT ever did.

Security teams are being asked to secure something they can’t see. That’s the problem we’re solving.

### Who This Is For

We work with security-conscious organizations that want to embrace AI without compromising control. That includes:

- Enterprises in regulated industries  
- Security leaders dealing with AI governance pressure  
- Teams building AI features into their own products  
- Anyone who needs to make AI safe, not just available  

---

### What We Believe

AI is not a feature. It’s an architectural shift.

Security needs to meet it at that level. That means thinking in terms of:

- **Dynamic content protection**, not static filters  
- **Policy logic**, not just perimeter defense  
- **Interoperability across AI vendors**, not vendor lock-in  
- **Deployment speed**, because AI adoption is not slowing down  

We aren’t chasing the threat of the week. We're building the foundation.

### Where We're Going

Our roadmap includes:

- Developer SDKs for embedding AI safety at the application layer  
- Vertical-specific protections for healthcare, finance, and legal  
- Threat detection for prompt injection, jailbreaks, and LLM abuse  
- Contributions to regulatory frameworks and industry standards

We're early, but the signals are clear. AI-native security will define the next generation of infrastructure. We're building for that.

If you're working on anything related—AI, security, compliance, infrastructure—we’d love to connect.
