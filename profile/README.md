### The Problem

AI is being adopted faster than it can be secured.

Most companies have no control over what data is going into tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot — and no visibility into what’s coming back out.

Sensitive code, PII, credentials, and proprietary logic are being exposed daily. Existing security tools can’t see it, can’t stop it, and weren’t built for this.

---

### What We’re Building

Qubase is an AI Security Gateway that:

- Intercepts traffic between users and LLMs
- Detects and controls sensitive data exposure
- Enforces org-level AI usage policies
- Works across AI platforms, without vendor lock-in

No endpoint agents, no heavy integration, no disruption to how teams work.

### Who It's For

- Security teams looking for control without slowing AI adoption  
- Enterprises under regulatory pressure (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)  
- Builders embedding AI in products who want safe defaults  

---

### Where We're Going

We're focused on:

- Real-time data classification and redaction  
- Policy-based control across LLM vendors  
- Full audit visibility into AI interactions  
- SDKs for developer-facing use  

We're early. We're building. We're talking to teams facing this problem right now.
